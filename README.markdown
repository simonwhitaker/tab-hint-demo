# Tab Hint Demo

This is a demonstration of a technique for using a gravity-bound animated view to offer a visual hint to a user that action on one tab in an iOS app results in content change on another. A common scenario where you might find this useful is if you have a Downloads tab and actions on other tabs can result in an item being added to the Downloads queue.
